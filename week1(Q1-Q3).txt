1. Try the statements below in REPL. Please answer that there are correct or not and
explain the reasons.


a.var id = 9527 (0)

b.var number : Int = 5.6 (x)

the floating-point literal does not conform to the expected type Int

c.var title = "Hello Kotlin!"(0)

d.val content : String = null(x)

 null can not be a value of a non-null type String

e.val number : Double? = 556.6(0)

f. var list: List<String>? = listOf (null, null) (x)

type inference failed. Expected type mismatch: inferred type is List<Nothing?> but List<String>? was expected


g. var list: List<String?>? = listOf ("Wayne", "Chen") (0)

h. list.size(x)


only safe (?.) or non-null asserted (!!.) calls are allowed on a nullable receiver of type List<String?>?


i. list?.size(0)




2. Read the code below, choose the correct answer and explain the reason.


What will the code print?

c."Your grace." (words' length is 39) 


3. Read the code below, choose the correct answer and explain the reason.

d. val array = Array(6) { 1000.0.pow( it ) }
